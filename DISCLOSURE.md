# DISCLOSURE.md — Pre-Existing Work vs. Hackathon Build

> Required transparency document for The Synthesis hackathon submission.
> DJZS Protocol existed as an independent project before the hackathon was announced.
> This document clearly separates what was built before vs. during the competition.

## Pre-Existing Infrastructure (Before March 13, 2026)

The following components existed as part of the DJZS Protocol project prior to The Synthesis hackathon. These represent foundational infrastructure and research, not the hackathon submission itself.

**Core Protocol Architecture**
- Adversarial audit engine using Venice AI (llama-3.3-70b at temperature 0)
- DJZS-LF failure taxonomy design (7 original codes: S01, S02, E01, E02, I01, I02, X01)
- Irys Datachain integration for immutable Proof-of-Logic certificate storage
- x402 USDC micropayment verification on Base Mainnet
- Three-tier pricing model (Micro $0.10, Founder $1.00, Treasury $10.00)

**Server & Client**
- Express.js backend with audit routes, payment verification, and Irys upload
- React + TypeScript + Tailwind frontend (x402 Audit Console, Live Demo)
- BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Venice AI integration

**Agent Infrastructure**
- XMTP MLS encrypted agent channel with prefix routing (`Thinking:` / `Journal:`)
- OpenClaw agent runner (JournalInsight + AdversarialOracle dispatchers)
- Venice AI client with persona-based model mapping

**Security**
- Phala Network TEE deployment (Intel SGX hardware enclave)
- Prompt injection defense pipeline (~2,900 lines TypeScript)
- Credential leak detection module
- Rate limiting (per-IP/wallet/tier)

**Identity**
- ENS identity (`djzsx.eth`) and Web3.bio resolution
- Landing page at djzs.ai
- GitHub repository (UsernameDAOEth/djzs-AI) — 1,100+ commits pre-hackathon

## Built During The Synthesis Hackathon (March 13–22, 2026)

The following work was performed during the official hackathon build window. This represents the submission — new on-chain infrastructure, integration work, and demonstration of the protocol in the context of the hackathon's themes.

**On-Chain Identity**
- ERC-8004 agent registration on Base Mainnet via The Synthesis platform
- Registration TX: [0x99b9fc...1ce23](https://basescan.org/tx/0x99b9fcfc64af207771afde1851fa7e569e5161d5bb166dbd000b44743bd1ce23)

**Smart Contract Deployment (4 new contracts on Base Mainnet)**
- `DJZSLogicTrustScore` — on-chain reputation scoring (0–1000) with trust tiers, pass bonuses, fail penalties, and time decay
  - Address: [0xB3324D07A8713b354435FF0e2A982A504e81b137](https://basescan.org/address/0xB3324D07A8713b354435FF0e2A982A504e81b137#code)
- `DJZSStaking` — USDC staking with slashing mechanics tied to audit outcomes
  - Address: [0xA362947D23D52C05a431E378F30C8A962De91e8A](https://basescan.org/address/0xA362947D23D52C05a431E378F30C8A962De91e8A#code)
- `DJZSEscrowLock` — conditional capital release gated by audit verdict (PASS releases, FAIL locks)
  - Address: [0xB041760147a60F63Ca701da9e431412bCc25Cfb7](https://basescan.org/address/0xB041760147a60F63Ca701da9e431412bCc25Cfb7#code)
- `DJZSAgentRegistry` — capability-based agent discovery with trust score integration
  - Address: [0xe40d5669Ce8e06A91188B82Ce7292175E2013E41](https://basescan.org/address/0xe40d5669Ce8e06A91188B82Ce7292175E2013E41#code)
- All contracts verified on BaseScan and Sourcify

**Integration Work (New Code)**
- `chainWriter.ts` — wires audit engine output to DJZSLogicTrustScore contract (on-chain score write after each audit)
- `irysWriter.ts` — abstracted Irys upload module for Proof-of-Logic certificates
- `escrowGate.ts` — escrow gate module: audit verdict controls DJZSEscrowLock release/lock
- End-to-end pipeline: agent memo → adversarial audit → on-chain score + Irys certificate → escrow gate

**Audit Engine Hardening (7 reliability fixes)**
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for Venice API calls
- Configurable model via environment variables
- Robust multi-strategy JSON parser (direct → regex → graceful fallback)
- Configurable fetch timeout (default 30s)
- Typed IntelligenceContext interface
- Structured success logging
- Single verdict source of truth

**Failure Taxonomy Completion**
- Extended DJZS-LF from 7 to 11 codes:
  - Added C01 (CONTEXT_HALLUCINATION), C02 (TEMPORAL_MISMATCH), R01 (RISK_BLINDSPOT), R02 (POSITION_SIZE_VIOLATION)
- Updated regression test suite to cover all 11 codes

**Demo & Submission Artifacts**
- Demo UI (`/demo` route) for hackathon judging
- Conversation log documenting full human-agent collaboration
- Demo script (2-minute narration with timing marks)
- Deployed Contracts section added to djzs.ai/docs
- Updated README with hackathon context, contract addresses, and architecture diagram

**Documentation Updates**
- CONTRACTS.md with all deployed addresses and BaseScan links
- Updated .env.example with contract address variables
- Hackathon Submission section added to README

## Philosophy

DJZS Protocol was not built for this hackathon. It was built because autonomous agents need an adversarial verification layer before they deploy capital. The Synthesis hackathon provided the context to deploy the on-chain components, wire the end-to-end flow, and demonstrate the protocol against the exact problem the competition describes: "How do you trust something without a face?"

The pre-existing infrastructure is the foundation. The hackathon work is the proof that it works on-chain, in production, with real contracts on Base Mainnet.
